RAG System Test Document

This is a test document for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.
The system uses vector embeddings to enable semantic search across documents.

Key Features:
- Document indexing with intelligent chunking
- Semantic search using vector similarity
- Redis caching for improved performance
- Async processing with BullMQ queues
- Real-time job status tracking

Testing the upload, indexing, and search functionality to ensure the complete workflow operates correctly.
This document contains specific keywords that should be searchable, such as:
- vector embeddings
- semantic search
- document indexing
- Redis caching
- async processing

The system should be able to find this content when searching for any of these terms or related concepts.
