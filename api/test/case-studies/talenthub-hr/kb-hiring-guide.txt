# TalentHub - Hiring Best Practices Guide

This guide covers best practices for using TalentHub to optimize your hiring process.

## Writing Effective Job Descriptions

### Structure
1. **Job Title**: Use standard titles (avoid creative titles that reduce searchability)
2. **Company Overview**: 2-3 sentences about your company and culture
3. **Role Summary**: What the person will do and their impact
4. **Responsibilities**: 5-7 bullet points of key duties
5. **Requirements**: Must-have qualifications (be realistic)
6. **Nice-to-Haves**: Preferred but not required skills
7. **Benefits & Perks**: Salary range, benefits, remote policy
8. **How to Apply**: Clear instructions

### Tips for Better Applications
- Include salary range (increases applications by 30%)
- Limit requirements to true must-haves
- Use inclusive language (TalentHub has a built-in bias checker)
- Keep it under 700 words
- Add company photos and videos

## Setting Up Your Hiring Pipeline

### Recommended Stages
1. **New** - Unreviewed applications
