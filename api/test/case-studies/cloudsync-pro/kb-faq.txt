## Collaboration

**Q: How many people can edit a document at once?**
A: Up to 50 users can simultaneously edit a document in real-time. Changes are synced instantly with all viewers.

**Q: Can I see who made changes to a file?**

**Q: How do I add comments to a file?**
A: Open the file in our web viewer, highlight any text or area, and click the comment icon. You can @mention team members to notify them.

## Mobile & Desktop

**Q: Does CloudSync Pro work offline?**
A: Yes! Mark files or folders as "Available Offline" and they'll be accessible without internet. Changes sync automatically when you reconnect.

**Q: How do I enable automatic photo backup on mobile?**
A: Open the mobile app > Settings > Photos > Enable Auto Backup. You can choose to backup only on WiFi to save data.

**Q: Why is my desktop app using so much battery?**
A: If syncing many files, the app works harder. To reduce battery usage: Settings > Power > Enable Battery Saver Mode. This reduces sync frequency when on battery.

## Security

**Q: Is my data encrypted?**
A: Yes, we use AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit. Enterprise plans can enable zero-knowledge encryption where even we can't access your files.

**Q: Can CloudSync Pro employees see my files?**
A: No. Our architecture uses encryption that prevents anyone, including our employees, from accessing your file contents. Metadata (filenames, sizes) is visible for support purposes only with your permission.

**Q: What happens if I lose my phone?**
A: Log into cloudsyncpro.com/security from any device, click "Active Sessions," and revoke access from the lost device. Enable 2FA for additional protection.

## Technical

A: Desktop app requires Windows 10+ or macOS 10.14+. Mobile apps need iOS 14+ or Android 8+. Web access works on any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

**Q: Why are some files not syncing?**
A: Common reasons include: file is open in another app, filename contains invalid characters (\ / : * ? " < > |), file exceeds size limit, or sync is paused. Check Settings > Sync for details.

**Q: How do I integrate CloudSync Pro with Slack?**
A: Go to Settings > Integrations > Slack > Connect. Authorize the connection, then select which notifications you want in Slack (file shares, comments, mentions).
