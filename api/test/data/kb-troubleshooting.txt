# CloudSync Pro - Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common issues and their solutions.

## Sync Issues

### Files Not Syncing

**Symptoms**: Files are stuck on "Syncing" or changes aren't appearing on other devices.

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify you have sufficient storage space (both local and cloud)
3. Ensure the file isn't open in another application
4. Restart the CloudSync Pro app
5. Check if the file is in the excluded files list (Settings > Sync > Excluded Files)

**File Types That Cannot Sync**:
- System files (e.g., desktop.ini, .DS_Store)
- Temporary files (~$filename.docx)
- Files larger than your plan's limit
- Files with invalid characters: \ / : * ? " < > |

### Sync Conflicts

**What causes conflicts**: When the same file is edited on multiple devices before syncing.

**Resolution**:
1. CloudSync Pro automatically creates conflict copies
2. Find conflict copies named "filename (conflicted copy DATE).ext"
3. Compare both versions and merge changes manually
4. Delete the unwanted version

## Login & Account Issues

### Forgot Password

1. Go to cloudsyncpro.com/reset-password
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your inbox for the reset link (valid for 24 hours)
4. Create a new password (minimum 8 characters, must include number and symbol)

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues

**Lost access to authenticator app**:
1. Use one of your backup codes (provided during 2FA setup)
2. If no backup codes, contact support with ID verification

**2FA not working**:
1. Ensure your device time is correct (auto-sync recommended)
2. Try entering the code immediately after it refreshes
3. Regenerate 2FA in Settings > Security

### Account Locked

Your account may be locked after 5 failed login attempts.

**To unlock**:
1. Wait 15 minutes for automatic unlock
2. Or use "Forgot Password" to reset immediately
3. Contact support if problem persists

## Performance Issues

### Slow Upload/Download

**Possible causes and solutions**:
1. Check your internet speed at speedtest.net
2. Adjust bandwidth limits: Settings > Network > Bandwidth
3. Reduce number of concurrent uploads: Settings > Advanced > Max Concurrent Transfers
4. Use wired connection instead of WiFi when possible
5. Temporarily pause other bandwidth-heavy applications

### High CPU/Memory Usage

1. Check how many files are being synced
2. Exclude large folders that don't need real-time sync
3. Update to the latest version of CloudSync Pro
4. Reduce sync frequency: Settings > Sync > Check for changes every X minutes

## Mobile App Issues

### App Crashing

1. Force close and restart the app
2. Check for app updates in App Store/Play Store
3. Clear app cache: Settings > App > CloudSync Pro > Clear Cache
4. Reinstall the app (your synced files are safe in the cloud)

### Photos Not Backing Up

1. Ensure photo backup is enabled: Settings > Photos > Auto Backup
2. Grant photo library permission to CloudSync Pro
3. Check if you're on WiFi (Settings > Photos > WiFi Only)
4. Verify sufficient cloud storage
